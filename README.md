## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the research, financial models, benchmarking data, and strategic roadmap developed by the GWU Consulting Team to support **GlobalGiving** in assessing its financial positioning and preparing for its ambitious goal of raising **$1 Billion by 2028**. 

Our work benchmarks GlobalGiving against key nonprofit players in the U.S. philanthropic ecosystem, evaluates core financial ratios, and proposes data-backed recommendations for scalable, digital-first growth.
